<h1>Cyber Security Facts</h1>
<ol style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif, 'larger';">
    <li>Cyber Threats are Diverse: Cyber threats come in various forms, including malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, and more. Each type of threat requires a specific approach for prevention. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Protecting Information: Internet security is like a digital shield that helps keep our personal information safe when we use the internet.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Strong Passwords Matter: Just like a secret code, having strong and unique passwords for our online accounts helps keep them secure.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Locking the Virtual Door: It's important to use secure websites (those with "https://" in the address) to make sure our online activities are safe and private.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Beware of Tricky Messages: Sometimes, people online may try to trick us with fake messages or emails. We should always check with a trusted adult if something seems suspicious.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Updates Keep us Safe: Just like our toys get new features, our devices need updates to fix bugs and stay safe from online bugs. Always keep your devices updated.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Think Before Clicking: Before clicking on links or downloading things online, it's smart to double-check and make sure they're from trusted sources. This helps avoid nasty surprises</li>
    <br>
    <li>Cyber Friends Need Caution: Online friends may not always be who they say they are. It's important to only chat with people we know in real life and to tell a trusted adult if someone online makes us uncomfortable.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Ask for Help: If something online seems confusing or if we're not sure what to do, it's okay to ask a parent, teacher, or another trusted adult for help. They can guide us to make safe choices on the internet.</li>
